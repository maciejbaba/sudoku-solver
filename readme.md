# Sudoku Solver

## Description

This is a sudoku solver written in Javascript. It uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the sudoku puzzle.
It was done for fun and to learn more about backtracking algorithms, that blow my mind.

## Not a lot of commits

This project has not a lot of commits because I didn't plan to make it public. I just wanted to solve a sudoku puzzle and I thought it would be fun to write a program to do it for me. I didn't even use git for this project, I just uploaded it to github to host it and later did some changes that solved issues.
